issues:
  - >-
    The conversion mechanism provided by the API to convert non-UUID resource
    id to UUID is now also based on the user creating/accessing the resource.
    This makes sure that the conversion generates a unique UUID for the user
    and that several users can use the same string as `original_resource_id`.
upgrade:
  - >-
    Since `original_resource_id` is now unique per creator, that means users
    cannot refer to resource by using the `original_resource_id` if the
    resource was not created by them.
