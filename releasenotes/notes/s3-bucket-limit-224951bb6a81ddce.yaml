    Previously, s3 storage driver stored aggregates in a bucket per metric.
    This would quickly run into bucket limit set by s3. s3 storage driver is
    fixed so it stores all aggregates for all metrics in a single bucket.
    Buckets previously created by Gnocchi will need to be deleted as they will
    no longer be handled.
