fixes:
  - \'/\' in resource id and metric name have been accepted by mistake, because
    they can be POSTed but not GETed/PATCHed/DELETEd. Now this char is forbidden
    in resource id and metric name, REST api will return 400 if it presents.
    Metric name and resource id already present with a \'/\' have their \'/\' replaced
    by \'_\'.
