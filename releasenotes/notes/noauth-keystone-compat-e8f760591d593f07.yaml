    The `auth_type` option has a new value "noauth-keystone-compat" which
    allows to user Gnocchi REST API with no authentication while keeping the
    Keystone segregation rules. This was the default up to Gnocchi 3.0.
    The new "basic" default does not include segregation and does not use the
    old Keystone headers (`X-User-Id` and `X-Creator-Id`) but the standard HTTP
    `Authorization` header.
