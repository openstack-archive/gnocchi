    The `auth_type` option has a new default value set to "basic". This mode
    does not do any segregation and uses the standard HTTP `Authorization`
    header for authentication. The old "noauth" authentication mechanism based
    on the Keystone headers (`X-User-Id`, `X-Creator-Id` and `X-Roles`) and the
    Keystone segregation rules, which was the default up to Gnocchi 3.0, is
    still available.
