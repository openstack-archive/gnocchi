    The S3 driver now checks for data consistency by default. S3 does not
    guarantee read-after-write consistency when overwriting data. Gnocchi now
    waits up to `s3_check_consistency_timeout` seconds before returning and
    unlocking a metric for new processing. This makes sure that the data that
    will be read by the next workers will be consistent and that no data will
    be lost. This feature can be disabled by setting the value to 0.
