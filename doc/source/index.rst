Why Gnocchi?
------------

Gnocchi has been created to fulfill the need of a time series database usable
in the context of cloud computing: providing the ability to store large
quantities of metrics. It has been designed to handle large amount of measures
being stored, while being performant, scalable and fault-tolerant. While doing
this, the goal was to be sure to not build any hard dependency on any complex
storage system.

The Gnocchi project was started in 2014 as a spin-off of the `OpenStack
Ceilometer`_ project to address the performance issues that Ceilometer
encountered while using standard databases as a storage backends for metrics.
