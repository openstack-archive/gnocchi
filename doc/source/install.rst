Project Architecture
======================

Gnocchi is built around 2 main components: a storage driver and an indexer
driver. The REST API exposed to the user manipulates both these drivers to
provide all the features that are needed to provide correct infrastructure
measurement.

The *storage* is responsible for storing measures of created metrics. It
receives timestamps and values and computes aggregations according to the
defined archive policies.

The *indexer* is responsible for storing the index of all resources, along with
their types and their properties. Gnocchi only knows resource types from the
OpenStack project, but also provides a *generic* type so you can create basic
resources and handle the resource properties yourself. The indexer is also
responsible for linking resources with metrics.

Installation Using Devstack
===========================

To enable Gnocchi in devstack, add the following to local.conf:

::

    enable_plugin gnocchi https://github.com/openstack/gnocchi master
    enable_service gnocchi-api,gnocchi-metricd

To enable Grafana support in devstack, you can also enable `gnocchi-grafana`::

    enable_service gnocchi-grafana

Then, you can start devstack:

::

    ./stack.sh


Installation Using Sources
==========================

To install Gnocchi, run the standard Python installation procedure:

::

    pip install -e .


Configuration
=============

Configure Gnocchi by editing `/etc/gnocchi/gnocchi.conf`.

No config file is provided with the source code, but one can be easily
created by running:

::

    tox -e genconfig

This command will create an `etc/gnocchi/gnocchi.conf` file which can be used
as a base for the default configuration file at `/etc/gnocchi/gnocchi.conf`. If
you're using _devstack_, this file is already generated and put in place.

The configuration file should be pretty explicit, but here are some of the base
options you want to change and configure:


+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Option name         | Help                                              |
+=====================+===================================================+
| storage.driver      | The storage driver for metrics.                   |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| indexer.url         | URL to your indexer.                              |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| storage.file_*      | Configuration options to store files              |
|                     | if you use the file storage driver.               |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| storage.swift_*     | Configuration options to access Swift             |
|                     | if you use the Swift storage driver.              |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| storage.ceph_*      | Configuration options to access Ceph              |
|                     | if you use the Ceph storage driver.               |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+


Gnocchi provides these storage drivers:

- File (default)
- `Swift`_
- `Ceph`_
- `InfluxDB`_ (experimental)

Gnocchi provides these indexer drivers:

- `PostgreSQL`_ (recommended)
- `MySQL`_

.. _`Ceph`: http://ceph.com/
.. _`PostgreSQL`: http://postgresql.org
.. _`MySQL`: http://mysql.com
.. _`InfluxDB`: http://influxdb.com

Indexer Initialization
======================

Once you have configured Gnocchi properly, you need to initialize the indexer:

::

    gnocchi-dbsync


Running Gnocchi
===============

To run Gnocchi, simply run the HTTP server and metric daemon:

::

    gnocchi-api
    gnocchi-metricd


Running As A WSGI Application
=============================

It's possible – and strongly advised – to run Gnocchi through a WSGI
service such as `mod_wsgi`_ or any other WSGI application. The file
`gnocchi/rest/app.wsgi` provided with Gnocchi allows you to enable Gnocchi as
a WSGI application.
For other WSGI setup you can refer to the `pecan deployement`_ documentation.
